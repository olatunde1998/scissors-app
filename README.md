## Scissors App

Hello, ðŸ‘‹ \
Scissor allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the Scissor platform and a shorter URL gets automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as possible, making it easy to share on social media or through other channels.
```
Here's some notes about my submission:

1. A link to the project repository  https://github.com/olatunde1998/scissors-app

2. A publicly live hosted URL of the challenge https://altschool-vue-exam-3.vercel.app/ 

Thank you very much AltSchool Africa.
Best regards
Rasheed Olatunde
